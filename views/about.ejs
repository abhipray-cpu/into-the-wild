                                    novella The Body, this tells the tale of four kids who embark on a camping trip just to see a dead body in the woods. As the young boys survive nature and some bullies, they bond together in an adventure of a lifetime.
                                    The movie again celebrates simplicity and the innocence of childhood. It can make one wonder that one might be living the best years of their lives without actually realizing it. The film ends on a realistic note that
                                    all four friends grow up to have their own lives, and the bond they once shared fades away. But at least, the memory of that summer hiking trip still remains etched in their minds. It's highly possible for everyone
                                    who has watched this movie to get all teary-eyed thinking about Stand by Me.

                                    drama details the life of Mason and his ordinary teenage life. Most of the film feels improvised with not much of cinematic drama in it. But it's the sheer simplicity that makes it one of the best movies on the concept
                                    of self-discovery. As Mason grows up, his relationship changes with his mother, changing fathers, and life in general. Films like Boyhood are rare, as they for a change, would make audiences feel happy about their own

                                    lot of passion in this film that makes for feel-good, escapist fun. Stiller's lead Walter Mitty is an everyday man who is bored with the everyday monotony of life. He dreams of alternative scenarios where he gets to
                                    embark on romance and action-filled adventures. When unemployment starts knocking Mitty's door, he actually decided to make these alternative realities his own.

                                    Along with Witherspoon, it's Laura Dern who shines playing the protagonist's mother. From the title to the concept, Wild is similar to Into the Wild in many ways. Even though the latter's Supertramp doesn't face any

                                <h3>New Zealand native Taika Waititi had mastered the art of edgy children comedies long before Jojo Rabbit, with this 2016 adventure-comedy that went on to be the highest-grossing film of New Zealand. In this case also, a
                                    national manhunt is organized to find a missing kid and his grumpy foster uncle. The only difference is these two escape into the wild against their will and soon become national fugitives. Hunt for the Wilderpeople
                                    benefits largely from its performances by debutant Julian Dennison (some might recognize him as the kid from Deadpool 2) and veteran Sam Neil, along with Waititi's offbeat screenplay. An added bonus is the visually-pleasing

                                    an adventure film with traces of a rom-com and coming-of-age drama.The plot revolves around two young lovers who flee their town, rejecting society. Without any proper planning, they still plan to live together in a
                                    natural habitat, their love and sense of adventure keeping them alive. Meanwhile, the town gets frantic as it sets out on a search party to find these kids. A moving story, themes of innocence, and Anderson's signature
                                    aesthetics and humor make it one of the most memorable entries in his filmography.</h3>

                                <h3>Another family-bonding film that has a similar premise is Debra Granik's heavily-acclaimed feature Leave No Trace. In this indie drama too, a father and a daughter attempt to reenter normal society, as they're forced out
                                    of the National Park land where they dwelled in a self-sustainable manner. While the daughter is willing to give normal life a shot, it's her father who becomes stubborn and tries to go back to his old ways. There isn't
                                    much of a story in the film; a lot of the conflicting emotions are expressed subtly through Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie's powerful performances. If emotional slow-burn movies go down your valley, then this is the

                                    at all. Apart from Mortensen's moving performance as a confused but responsible father, the movie's moral conflicts and social comedy is what makes it totally worth a watch.</h3>

                                    Guevara biopic as the film covers the earlier parts of his life. The film depicts Ernesto as a young medical student who takes his friend Alberto on a motorcycle trip all across South America. On his journey, he discovers
                                    several harsh realities of society and gets moved by the conditions of the indigenous people in various countries. This eventually moves him to take up their cause later on in life. Based on Guevara's memoir, the movie
                                    is a moving journey of how travel and observations can totally change a person. While Into the Wild's Supertramp decided to change his life for himself, Che Guevara decides to change the life of the people around him.</h3>
